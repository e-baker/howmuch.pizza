# mowmuch.pizza

This project is a fun little project in Angular 5 that allows me the ability to show I can indeed write Angular code. It also serves the purpose of giving me a helpful little calculator for how much pizza is needed.

##CHANGELOG:

*3/1/18 - modified the code to allow for adults, teenagers, and children to be differentiated. (v2)

##TODO:

*Allow for the input of available pizza sizes so the calculator can use that information to give the most efficient use of pizzas.
*Allow for the input of pricing along with available sizes so the calculator can find the most economical route to pizza.
